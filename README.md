# Description
This is a Node.js application that allows the user to easily generate an HTML page with the roles and basic info of each member of a development team. This app demonstrates use of the Inquirer NPM (v. 8.2.4) to handle command line prompts, the Jest NPM (v. 29.4.2) to handle development testing, and the use of classes/subclasses and helper functions to supplement the program's central logic. To view the program in action, [click this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5VhQv2dQBLdlbPbXKgaXXY2WQ8L_N1u/view) for a recorded demo. To view a template mockup of a generated HTML page, refer to the index.html file contained in the temp folder.

# Installation
This program utilizes the Inquirer and Jest NPMs. In order to use the app, first ensure it is copied to your local system, then navigate to the parent folder in your command line and enter 'npm install.'
# Usage
In your command line, navigate to the parent folder and enter 'node index.js' to initiate the program. You must enter the manager's info to generate a page -- once this is done, you will also be presented with the option to add as many engineers or interns as you'd like. When all employee's info has been entered, select the 'Finished adding team members' option in the menu. A 'Page ready' notification will appear in your command line, and your generated HTML page will appear in the 'dist' folder. Make sure you put this file somewhere safe (or rename it) before using the app again, as it will be overwritten otherwise. To run the four test suites contained in the 'test' folder, enter 'npm test' in the command line while the program is not currently running.
